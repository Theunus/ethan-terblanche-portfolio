            <h3>1. Context</h3>
            <p>The artefact I have selected is my participation in an interview for the Junior Hospital Management
                Officer (Health Systems Strengthening) position at Charlotte Maxeke Academic Hospital. The interview was
                conducted by a panel of senior staff members, including individuals involved in hospital management,
                clinical governance, and health systems strengthening. I chose this artefact because it represents an
                important moment in my transition from academic learning to the practical environment of the South
                African public health system. It allowed me to engage directly with the real-world expectations of a
                health system strengthening role, particularly one aligned with the competencies I have developed
                throughout my Health Systems Science Honours programme.
                The job advert highlighted several elements that resonated with my coursework, including a focus on
                improving service delivery, patient experience, operational coordination, and quality of care. It
                explicitly targeted recent graduates in Health Systems Science and emphasised competencies such as
                systems thinking, analytical skills, collaborative work, ethical conduct, and a willingness to develop
                leadership capacity . This alignment made the interview meaningful because it required me to demonstrate
                these competencies in a professional and applied context.
            </p>

            <h3>2. Reflection</h3>
            <p>The interview contributed significantly to my development and understanding of Health Systems Science
                competencies. Preparing for the interview required me to revisit core concepts such as hospital
                performance indicators, patient flow, clinical governance, complaint management, and quality
                improvement, all of which were highlighted in the role description . This strengthened my ability to
                connect theoretical learning with real operational challenges.
                One of the key reflections from this artefact relates to systems thinking. During the interview, the
                panel asked questions about improving continuity of care, reducing waiting times, and supporting patient
                safety audits. These questions required me to recognise how different components of the system are
                interconnected. This reflects the World Health Organization’s view that health systems operate through
                interacting building blocks and that changes in one area influence others (WHO 2007). My responses drew
                on what I had learned in the honours programme about complexity, interdependence and the need to think
                beyond isolated units.
                The interview also prompted reflection on my communication and collaboration skills. Engaging with a
                panel required clarity, confidence and an appreciation for multidisciplinary perspectives. This linked
                directly to literature showing that effective teamwork is essential for safe, high-quality health care
                (Reeves et al. 2017). I realised that the honours programme had prepared me to interact professionally
                and present ideas based on evidence and structured reasoning.
                Another competency strengthened by this artefact was ethical and professional conduct. The role stresses
                respect, professionalism and ethical reasoning as core expectations . Reflecting on the interview, I
                recognised how my training in ethical frameworks, fairness and patient-centred decision making shaped
                the way I approached questions about patient complaints, service responsiveness and community
                engagement. Literature by Beauchamp and Childress (2019) emphasises that ethical practice requires
                awareness of autonomy, justice and beneficence. These principles influenced how I framed my responses.
                The artefact also reinforced my leadership awareness. Even though the role targets recent graduates, the
                career pathway described in the advert highlights development toward future leadership roles such as
                Clinical Governance Coordinator and Hospital CEO . Reflecting on this encouraged me to think about how
                my confidence and decision-making abilities have grown and how I might continue developing these
                competencies.
                The interview helped me understand the importance of analytical and evidence-informed decision making.
                Questions about problem solving and performance indicators required me to think critically and apply
                data-driven reasoning. This aligns with Greenhalgh’s (2014) perspective that analytical skills
                strengthen decision making in health systems.
                This artefact was valuable because it placed me in a setting where I had to apply the competencies I
                have been developing throughout the programme. It reinforced my readiness to transition into the health
                system and highlighted areas for continued growth.

            <h2>Personal Statement: My Developing Professional Identity</h2>
            <p>My understanding of my professional identity has grown significantly throughout my Health Systems Science
                training. The process of developing my personal statement has shown me how my values, skills and
                attitudes have evolved across three key areas. These areas are empathy, critical thinking and ethical
                action. Each of these domains has influenced the way I see myself and the way I hope to contribute to
                the health system.</p>
            <h2>Empathy</h2>
            <p>My initial view of empathy was rooted in the idea of being present with another person’s experience and
                listening without the need to fix or interpret their reality. I associated empathy with presence,
                dignity and connection. I valued the ability to listen actively and allow space for others, which I
                believed helped prevent misunderstanding and supported meaningful relationships. This understanding is
                reflected in my original statement, where I emphasised curiosity and patience as foundations for
                connection .
                After working through the learning content, I realised that empathy is not something one either has or
                does not have. It is a skill that requires regular practice. Discussions and readings, including
                perspectives such as Brené Brown’s distinction between empathy and sympathy, helped me recognise that
                empathy involves boundaries and mindful engagement. Indigenous worldviews further expanded my
                understanding by emphasising accompaniment rather than absorbing another person’s pain. This showed me
                that empathy is relational and contextual rather than purely emotional. Reflecting on this, I now see
                empathy as a practice that requires presence, self-awareness and the ability to remain comfortable in
                silence or discomfort. My refined understanding highlights that empathy is not about seeing inside
                someone’s emotions but about being willing to stay with them in their experience with dignity and
                respect .
            </p>
            <h2>Critical Thinking</h2>
            <p>Critical thinking initially meant pausing, questioning and seeking deeper meaning in what I encountered.
                I saw it as a process of engaging with uncertainty while drawing on knowledge of power, systems and
                language. I valued truth seeking and accountability and relied on skills such as identifying
                assumptions, comparing perspectives and noticing contradictions. My early approach focused on
                responsible use of knowledge and avoiding unexamined repetition of ideas .
                Through readings and discussions that explored decoloniality and knowledge production, my understanding
                shifted. I learned that critical thinking is not limited to pointing out errors or identifying logical
                weaknesses. It is about understanding the origins of knowledge and interrogating whose voices are heard
                and whose are excluded. Thinkers such as Frantz Fanon and Walter Mignolo influenced my appreciation of
                how social structures shape knowledge. This moved my focus from judging individuals to examining broader
                systems. As a result, I now see critical thinking as a way of being more than a method of analysis. It
                requires openness, humility and the willingness to sit with discomfort. Silence and listening also form
                part of this practice. I have come to recognise that critical thinking is both reflective and relational
                .
            </p>
            <h2>Ethical Action</h2>
            <p>My early philosophy of ethical action centred on doing what is right, even when unnoticed or difficult. I
                associated ethical behaviour with principles that protect the good of both myself and others. I believed
                ethical action required knowledge of moral theories and the ability to identify tensions and potential
                consequences. I valued honesty, responsibility and courage. This understanding guided how I approached
                decision making and conflict .
                Through engagement with the course content, my understanding deepened. I had originally viewed ethics as
                a set of rules that offered clear answers. Through exploring relational and community based ethical
                theories, I learned that ethical action often arises in situations where the right answer is not clear.
                Ethical decisions rely on reflection, context and presence. I also became aware of the importance of
                relationships and responsiveness. The ethics of care literature emphasised that ethical behaviour
                involves attention to connection, responsibility and the needs of others. These perspectives helped me
                recognise that ethical action is an evolving practice shaped by who I am accountable to and the
                environments in which I work. Ethical living is not about perfection but about returning to reflection
                and learning repeatedly
            </p>
            <h2>Integrated Reflection</h2>
            <p >Across empathy, critical thinking and ethical action, I can see that my professional identity has shifted from relying on personal instinct to embracing reflective and intentional practice. Each competency has shaped the way I think, act and relate to others. I now understand my role in health systems as one requiring continuous learning, openness and humility. These competencies support meaningful engagement with patients, colleagues and communities and prepare me to contribute responsibly to the broader goals of equity and system strengthening.</p>
            <h3>1. Context</h3>
            <p>The artefact I selected is my Johari’s Window self-assessment exercise. This artefact includes four
                components that map my self-perception and how others perceive me. The sections displayed in my document
                include the Open Area, Blind Spot, Hidden Area and Unknown Area. Each quadrant captures insights about
                my dependability, empathy, creative strengths, leadership presence, resilience, personal vulnerabilities
                and unrealised potential .
                I chose this artefact because it offered a structured method for exploring my self-awareness and
                identity. It encouraged me to reflect not only on how I view myself, but also on how peers, colleagues
                and those close to me experience my behaviour, communication and emerging competencies. The inclusion of
                feedback from others, captured through a Google Form, further deepened the assessment. Responses
                highlighted competencies such as communication, collaboration, adaptability, health advocacy, ethical
                competence and leadership, which are central to Health Systems Science. These responses were summarised
                in the table on page 3, showing both strengths and areas for improvement in aspects such as composure,
                transparency and openness to alternative approaches .
                This artefact aligns well with the objectives of the Health Systems Science curriculum as it supports
                reflective practice, emotional intelligence, communication awareness and leadership development.
            </p>
            <h3>2. Reflection</h3>
            <p>Engaging with this Johari Window activity helped me understand myself more clearly, both in personal and
                professional contexts. The Open Area affirmed qualities that I already recognised, such as
                dependability, empathy and creativity. These traits appear in the first quadrant of my artefact, where I
                describe myself as caring, reflective and committed to others. It was meaningful to see these strengths
                mirrored by people who know me well, which is consistent with the statements in the Open Area on page 2
                .
                Reflecting on the Blind Spot allowed me to consider the qualities that others see but that I may
                overlook. For example, the document notes that people perceive me as a natural leader, someone who
                brings individuals together and offers stability in uncertain situations. The feedback on page 3
                supports this, where respondents strongly agreed that I collaborate well, maintain composure under
                pressure and encourage independent thinking . Recognising these perceptions helped me understand that
                leadership is not only about formal roles. It also involves everyday actions such as listening,
                organising and creating safe spaces for others. This insight contributed to my development of the
                leadership awareness competency in Health Systems Science.
                The Hidden Area encouraged deeper introspection. I noted private emotions, insecurities and the
                emotional toll of caregiving. This aligns with the reflective passage on page 4, where I acknowledge
                that some of my anxieties remain unshared. Reflecting on this helped me understand the importance of
                boundary setting and emotional awareness in health systems work. Professionals often carry emotional
                labour quietly, and recognising this in myself supports healthier patterns of resilience.
                The Unknown Area allowed me to consider possibilities and undiscovered aspects of myself. On page 2, I
                describe unrealised potential and unexplored interests. This quadrant helped me appreciate that personal
                growth is ongoing and that new strengths may emerge as my career and life experience evolve.
                What strengthened this artefact further was the structured feedback from others. The table on page 3
                highlighted competencies such as communication, ethical and cultural competence, adaptability,
                creativity and health advocacy as essential for becoming a stronger health systems thinker. These
                responses helped me understand how people experience my contributions in group settings and how these
                competencies align with the broader literature on effective practice in health systems.
                This process taught me that self-awareness is foundational for work in complex systems. It enhances
                interpersonal relationships, supports ethical decision making and strengthens professional identity. The
                reflective process captured on page 5 describes this journey as one of tenderness and curiosity. I now
                see myself as a work in progress, open to learning and capable of continuous growth in both personal and
                professional spheres

                <h3>Context</h3>
                <p>This artefact represents the completion of eight postgraduate GOLD01 research-based certificates.
                    These short learning programmes focused on research skills, academic development and system-level
                    understanding. I chose this artefact because completing eight separate certificates demonstrates
                    consistency, discipline and a commitment to strengthening my academic foundation across multiple
                    research domains. It also reflects my interest in expanding my capacity to engage with evidence,
                    interpret data and contribute meaningfully to the broader field of Health Systems Science.</p>

                <h3>Reflection</h3>
                <p>Completing eight research-based certificates allowed me to build confidence in my academic abilities
                    and strengthened several Health Systems Science competencies. Each certificate required independent
                    learning, engagement with academic literature and the application of research principles. This
                    aligned with my development in evidence-informed decision making, critical interpretation and
                    analytical reasoning. The repeated practice helped me refine my understanding of research
                    structures, improve my writing skills and become more comfortable engaging with unfamiliar material.
                </p>

                <p>The process also strengthened competencies such as adaptability and reflective practice. Moving
                    through eight certificates required time management, self-motivation and the ability to adjust to
                    different formats and expectations. I became more aware of my learning preferences and my ability to
                    work through challenges without external prompting. Completing the certificates also reinforced the
                    importance of continuous learning within health systems. It reminded me that research is a key
                    driver of quality improvement, equity and system strengthening.</p>

                <p>These certificates contributed to my growth by expanding my research capabilities and building the
                    confidence needed to apply these skills in real-world settings. I now have a stronger foundation for
                    academic work, postgraduate study or roles that require technical research skills.</p>
