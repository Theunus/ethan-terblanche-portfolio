            <h1>Personal Reflection on Competencies Developed During the Health Systems Science Honours Course</h1>

            <p>During my Health Systems Science Honours course, I became more aware of my developing competencies and how they can be applied within health systems. The learning experience encouraged ongoing reflection and helped me understand how theory and practice shape my professional identity.</p>

            <p>A key competency that developed was systems thinking. Through course content that explored how different components of a health system interact, I learned to understand health care as a complex adaptive system. This understanding aligns with the view that health systems function through interconnected relationships that influence outcomes at multiple levels (World Health Organization 2007). I found that I became more comfortable considering how decisions in one area may influence another. I plan to use this competency when working on programme design and improvement initiatives.</p>

            <p>My ability to make evidence-informed decisions strengthened during research activities and academic tasks. Engaging with peer-reviewed sources and policy documents encouraged me to assess evidence carefully and apply it thoughtfully. According to Sackett et al. (1996), evidence-based practice requires the integration of best research evidence with professional expertise. I found that this approach improved both my confidence and my ability to justify decisions. I aim to continue using this skill in future roles that rely on policy analysis or programme evaluation.</p>

            <p>Through group assignments, I developed stronger collaborative and interdisciplinary communication skills. Working with peers helped me appreciate the value of diverse perspectives. This is supported by literature that highlights how collaborative practice enhances problem solving and patient outcomes (Reeves et al. 2017). The experience made me more aware of the importance of active listening and shared responsibility within teams. I hope to use this competency when working in interdisciplinary environments.</p>

            <p>The course also encouraged the development of leadership awareness. Reflecting on my responses to group dynamics and tasks helped me identify strengths and areas for improvement. Northouse (2022) notes that leadership development requires self-reflection and awareness of personal behaviour. I realised that I often take initiative when tasks require structure and clarity, and I plan to build on this awareness by seeking opportunities to lead small projects or support colleagues.</p>

            <p>Learning about resource allocation and financial planning helped me develop financial literacy within health systems. Understanding budgets, cash flow and financial constraints made health care contexts more understandable. Literature emphasises that financial literacy supports effective management and planning in health systems (WHO 2010). I now recognise how financial decisions influence service delivery. I expect to apply this competency in both professional settings and personal financial planning.</p>

            <p>Another important area of growth was reflective practice. Regular reflection tasks encouraged me to think about my learning processes and professional behaviour. Schön (1983) explains that reflection supports personal growth and improved judgement. I noticed that reflective writing helped me identify patterns in my thinking and plan for improvement. I intend to continue using reflective practice as a tool for ongoing development.</p>

            <p>Exposure to topics such as equity and access helped me strengthen ethical and patient-centred thinking. Learning about health system challenges highlighted the importance of fairness, respect and responsibility. According to Beauchamp and Childress (2019), ethical practice requires awareness of autonomy, justice and beneficence. This content encouraged me to consider how decisions affect different groups. I hope to apply this competency when advocating for equitable policies and patient-focused care.</p>

            <p>I improved my analytical and critical interpretation skills. Evaluating policies and system gaps required a structured and focused approach. Critical interpretation is central to high quality decision making in health systems (Greenhalgh 2014). I became more comfortable identifying trends, gaps and connections within complex information. I will continue using this competency when reviewing research or contributing to health planning.</p>

            <p>The course supported a deeper understanding of health systems and encouraged personal and academic development. Each competency has shaped my approach to learning and practice, and I plan to use them as a foundation for future professional growth.</p>
