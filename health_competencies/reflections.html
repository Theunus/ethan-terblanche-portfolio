            <h2>Additional Reflection on My Learning Journey Across All HSS Modules</h2>

            <p>Reflecting on my journey through the Health Systems Science Honours programme, I can see clear development in how I think, work and position myself within complex health environments. Each module contributed to my growth in different but connected ways. Together, they helped shape a more confident, reflective and systems oriented version of myself.</p>

            <p>Systems Health was one of the first modules that shifted my approach to understanding complexity. I learned to see health care as a dynamic system where people, structures and processes influence one another. This guided me to think beyond isolated events and appreciate interconnectedness. Developing this systems perspective helped me approach challenges with a wider lens and encouraged me to look for root causes rather than superficial fixes.</p>

            <p>The module on Health Entrepreneurship challenged my creativity and confidence. It pushed me to explore innovation as part of problem solving. I realised that entrepreneurship within health systems is not only about business ideas but also about creating value, improving service delivery and introducing thoughtful change. This helped me understand the importance of adaptability, opportunity recognition and strategic thinking in health system environments.</p>

            <p>Innovative Health expanded my willingness to question traditional methods and consider new solutions. I learned how innovation can be applied responsibly and how it must align with patient needs and systemic realities. This strengthened my ability to think critically and propose changes grounded in evidence and feasibility. The module also encouraged me to engage more confidently in collaborative discussions and brainstorming activities.</p>

            <p>Through Managing Health Projects, I developed stronger organisational and leadership abilities. The module required practical project planning, stakeholder engagement and team coordination. It taught me how to set timelines, allocate tasks and anticipate risks. This strengthened my confidence in coordinating teams and improved my ability to communicate clearly when guiding group work. I also learned about accountability and the importance of transparency within project teams.</p>

            <p>The Learning in the Workplace module helped me understand professionalism and workplace responsiveness. It required me to reflect on my behaviour, communication patterns and interactions with others. This module supported the development of emotional intelligence and the application of ethical reasoning in real-world settings. It made me more aware of the importance of presence, active listening and understanding workplace culture.</p>

            <p>Developing Health Systems Competencies helped me integrate what I was learning into a clearer sense of professional identity. Through exercises such as the Johari Window, personal statements and self assessments, I began to recognise my strengths, blind spots and potential. The module supported reflective practice and encouraged me to consider the type of practitioner and leader I hope to become. It helped me connect my values with the competencies needed in the health system.</p>

            <p>Finally, Research Methodology strengthened the technical skills needed to understand and contribute to evidence-based practice. I became more confident in reading academic literature, formulating research questions and interpreting data. These skills influenced all other modules, as research connects directly to decision making, quality improvement and system strengthening. Completing eight research-based certificates reinforced these abilities further and helped me gain discipline in academic inquiry.</p>

            <p>Across all modules, I noticed that many competencies grew together rather than independently. Systems thinking, critical interpretation, ethical reasoning, communication, leadership awareness and adaptability became part of my everyday approach to learning. My confidence increased as I began to understand how these competencies support effective practice in health systems. Reflecting on where I began and where I am now, I can see growth in my self awareness, my problem solving approach and my ability to contribute meaningfully to conversations about health system challenges.</p>

            <p>This learning journey helped me realise that competency development is not a moment but a continuous process. Each module added another layer to my understanding and supported my transition from a student to a more reflective and capable emerging professional. I now feel more prepared to engage with real health system environments, contribute to improvement initiatives and continue developing my abilities with purpose and curiosity.</p>

            <h2>Understanding Core Competencies in Public Health</h2>
            <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OIAeC2Qf0Ko" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OIAeC2Qf0Ko</a></p>

            <h3>Reflection on the YouTube Video: “Understanding Core Competencies in Public Health”</h3>

            <p>Watching the video on core competencies in public health helped me deepen my understanding of what it means to develop as a professional within a health system. The video explains competencies not as isolated skills, but as interconnected capabilities that shape how individuals think, act and contribute within health environments. This view strongly aligns with what I have learned throughout my Health Systems Science Honours programme.</p>

            <p>One of the key ideas that stood out to me is the emphasis on systems thinking. The video highlights the importance of understanding how different parts of the health system relate to one another and how decisions can influence multiple outcomes. This reinforced what I learned in the Systems Health module, particularly the need to step back from individual problems and see patterns and relationships within the wider system.</p>

            <p>The video also discusses communication as a core competency. It explains that effective professionals are able to share information clearly, listen carefully and engage with diverse stakeholders. This aligns with the group work, presentations and workplace activities experienced throughout the year. It reminded me that communication is not simply about speaking well, but also about encouraging dialogue, supporting understanding and building trust.</p>

            <p>Another important competency in the video is leadership. It describes leadership as the ability to guide teams, manage change and work collaboratively across disciplines. This encouraged me to reflect on moments when I took initiative in group work, remained calm in uncertainty or helped create structure for a team. The video highlighted that leadership is not always formal. It often happens in small, everyday actions that support collective progress.</p>

            <p>The discussion of cultural and ethical competence also resonated with me. The video shows how public health professionals must act with respect, fairness and awareness of diverse experiences. This connected to my learning in ethical action, particularly the shift from following fixed rules to understanding relational responsibility. The video supported the idea that ethical behaviour is shaped by awareness, reflection and a commitment to equity.</p>

            <p>The video emphasises the importance of evidence-informed practice, which relates closely to the Research Methodology module and the research certificates I completed. It reminded me that high quality decisions rely on credible evidence, responsible interpretation and the ability to apply findings within specific contexts.</p>

            <p>The video helped me see how my competencies fit into broader public health frameworks. It confirmed that the skills I developed during the Honours programme are relevant and aligned with recognised standards in the field. It also encouraged me to continue strengthening these areas as I move into the workplace, where these competencies are needed to support meaningful contributions to health systems.</p>
