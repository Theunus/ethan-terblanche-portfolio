        <h1>Critical Reflective Analysis</h1>
        <p style="color:var(--dark-gray);margin-bottom:1.2rem">This page contains critical reflective analyses of three artefacts from the Responsible Health module.</p>

        <section class="section" id="artefact-1">
            <h2>Artefact 1: Leadership Style Test</h2>
            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>I completed an online leadership style test to assess my dominant tendencies in leadership. I answered as honestly as possible, aiming to gain an accurate understanding of how I naturally approach leadership situations.</p>

            <h3>Analysis</h3>
            <p>I noticed that the test results highlighted both strengths and potential limitations in my leadership style. Initially, I felt slightly defensive about the weaknesses, as they challenged my self-image. However, I recognised that the purpose was not to label me but to provide a mirror to reflect on how I interact with others.</p>

            <h3>Critical Evaluation</h3>
            <p>The activity connected with concepts of self-awareness and reflective practice in responsible leadership (Maak &amp; Pless, 2006). It also resonated with Schön’s (1983) idea of reflection-on-action, as I reviewed past decisions and considered how my leadership tendencies shaped them. My assumption that being consistent in one style is always positive was questioned; I realised flexibility is critical in health systems where contexts are unpredictable and diverse.</p>

            <h3>Learning and Application</h3>
            <p>I learnt that responsible leadership requires adaptability and awareness of how one’s natural style impacts others. This insight will inform my future practice by reminding me to pause and ask: Is my approach supporting inclusivity and accountability, or is it limiting dialogue? Going forward, I plan to intentionally practise adapting my style to the needs of the team and situation, rather than defaulting to what feels most natural.</p>

        <section class="section" id="artefact-2">
            <h2>Artefact 2: Managing within the Context of Responsible Leadership</h2>
            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>In a reflective activity, I considered what responsible management would look like and how I would manage from a responsible leadership perspective. The session built on prior activities and encouraged me to connect management functions with leadership values.</p>

            <h3>Analysis</h3>
            <p>I realised I had often thought of management in purely operational terms, coordinating resources, planning, and problem-solving. Through the reflection, I recognised that management and leadership are deeply connected, especially in contexts like healthcare where ethical decisions and human wellbeing are central.</p>

            <h3>Critical Evaluation</h3>
            <p>This reflection aligned with the competencies of accountability, transparency, and inclusivity that underpin responsible leadership (Doh &amp; Quigley, 2014). It also linked with Gibbs’ Reflective Cycle, as I moved from description and feelings to analysis and action. I identified that my assumption, that efficiency should always come first, could undermine responsibility if it excluded people or ignored ethical implications.</p>

            <h3>Learning and Application</h3>
            <p>I learnt that responsible management requires a balance of efficiency and conscience. For future practice, I want to prioritise inclusivity in decision-making, even if it requires slowing down. I also aim to practise transparency in how I communicate decisions, to foster trust and shared ownership. This activity expanded my view of management as not just a function but also a responsibility to others.</p>

        <section class="section" id="artefact-3">
            <h2>Artefact 3: Designing My Cultural Transformation Approach</h2>
            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>I developed an outline for leading cultural transformation in a health organisation, identifying challenges such as resistance to change and siloed departments. I created a step-by-step plan grounded in listening, vision-setting, partnerships, and evaluation.</p>

            <h3>Analysis</h3>
            <p>I felt both inspired and cautious while designing the approach. Inspired, because cultural transformation can unlock better collaboration and morale; cautious, because I recognised how easily such efforts can fail if imposed without genuine engagement.</p>

            <h3>Critical Evaluation</h3>
            <p>This activity connected directly with relational responsible leadership (Maak &amp; Pless, 2006), which emphasises co-creation and dialogue. It also reminded me of Brookfield’s Four Lenses, as I considered staff perspectives, my own assumptions, theoretical insights, and potential peer feedback. I realised my assumption, that cultural change requires big interventions, was limiting; instead, small, visible wins can often be more effective.</p>

            <h3>Learning and Application</h3>
            <p>I learnt that cultural transformation is not simply structural but relational. Responsible leaders must cultivate trust, transparency, and shared ownership to enable genuine change. Moving forward, I plan to practise involving others early in shaping initiatives and reinforcing progress through recognition of small steps. This reflection deepened my appreciation that responsible leadership is less about control and more about enabling an environment where change is shared and sustained.</p>
