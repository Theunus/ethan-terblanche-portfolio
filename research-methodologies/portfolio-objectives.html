        <div class="content-section">
            <p>This portfolio serves as both a record and reflection of my journey as a Health Systems Science (HSS) student. Through this process, I aim to capture how my academic experiences, professional development, and personal growth have shaped my understanding of the discipline and my readiness to move forward in my studies and career.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>1. Defining My Academic and Professional Goals</h2>
            <p>My main goal is to grow as a reflective, knowledgeable, and compassionate professional within the field of Health Systems Science. I want to build a strong foundation that allows me to contribute meaningfully to the improvement of healthcare systems. Academically, I aim to deepen my research skills and theoretical understanding. Professionally, I hope to apply this knowledge to real-world contexts that prioritise people, systems, and sustainability.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>2. Planning to Achieve My Goals</h2>
            <p>I plan to achieve these goals by engaging fully in coursework, research projects, and field-based learning opportunities. Each activity is an opportunity to connect theory with practice. I view these experiences as steps towards becoming more confident in applying HSS principles to practical problems within healthcare.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>3. Growth in Understanding My Specialisation</h2>
            <p>Throughout this programme, I have developed a clearer understanding of my area of interest and specialisation. I have learned that growth in any discipline comes through curiosity and consistent inquiry. My appreciation for how knowledge is created, tested, and applied has deepened, and I have begun to see how small insights can contribute to larger systemic improvements.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>4. Synthesising and Reflecting on My Learning Process</h2>
            <p>This portfolio allows me to look back and make sense of my learning experiences. Reflecting on what I have done helps me recognise how far I have come—how my thinking, approach to challenges, and confidence in academic writing have all evolved. Each task has shaped my understanding of research, collaboration, and the value of perseverance.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>5. Demonstrating Mastery of Knowledge in My Discipline</h2>
            <p>Through both coursework and research, I have gained a stronger grasp of the core knowledge within Health Systems Science. I have learned to integrate concepts from public health, management, and human behaviour to form a more holistic understanding of healthcare systems. I aim to continue refining this knowledge as I move toward more advanced levels of research and practice.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>6. Adapting Goals Through Reflection and Feedback</h2>
            <p>Feedback from supervisors, peers, and mentors has played an important role in shaping my learning journey. I have learned to approach feedback not as criticism, but as a tool for growth. My goals have shifted slightly as I’ve gained a better understanding of my strengths and areas for improvement, and I see this flexibility as an important part of academic maturity.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>7. Readiness for Future Research and Dissertation Work</h2>
            <p>As I progress through this programme, I feel increasingly ready to take on the next phase of independent research. The skills I have developed—particularly in research design, writing, and ethical awareness, form a solid foundation for my future dissertation work.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>Reflecting on the HSS Competency of Scholarship</h2>
            <p>This portfolio is also a reflection of my development in the HSS competency of Scholarship and its sub-competencies. Each of these areas has contributed to how I think, learn, and approach research.</p>
            <ol class="list-ol">
                <li>
                    <h3 style="font-size:1rem; margin-bottom:0.4rem;">Critical Thinking</h3>
                    <p>I have learned to question information thoughtfully, assess evidence carefully, and make reasoned judgments. This has helped me to form balanced perspectives and develop confidence in analysing complex health system challenges.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3 style="font-size:1rem; margin-bottom:0.4rem;">Research Design and Methodology</h3>
                    <p>Designing and planning research has taught me the importance of clarity and purpose. I have practised formulating research questions, choosing appropriate paradigms, and aligning methodology with objectives. These skills have strengthened my ability to conduct structured and meaningful inquiry.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3 style="font-size:1rem; margin-bottom:0.4rem;">Literature Review Skills</h3>
                    <p>Conducting literature reviews has helped me appreciate the depth of existing knowledge and the importance of identifying gaps. Synthesising different sources has taught me how knowledge evolves through dialogue and evidence.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3 style="font-size:1rem; margin-bottom:0.4rem;">Effective Communication</h3>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3 style="font-size:1rem; margin-bottom:0.4rem;">Ethical Conduct in Research</h3>
                    <p>I have come to value the ethical responsibility that comes with research. Respect for participants, transparency in data use, and integrity in reporting findings are principles I hold with care. Ethics has become not just a requirement, but a guiding value in my academic work.</p>
