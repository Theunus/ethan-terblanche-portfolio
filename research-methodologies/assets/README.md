This folder is for Research Methodology artefacts (PDFs and documents).

Place files here â€” current filenames in this folder (you can rename or replace these if you prefer):

- Academic Integrity Pledge.pdf
- Plagerism Acknowledgement .pdf
- Supervisor Letter.pdf
- Quantitative Presentation 1.pdf.pdf
- Research Protocol.docx.pdf
- TREE Ethics Certificate.pdf
- Ethics Certificate Clearnace.pdf

- Scoping Review Workshop Booklet_Student April2024.pdf
- References_used_for_Scoping_Review_Workshop_Slides_April2024.pdf
- Davies et al. 2022-For Activity 6.pdf

If you prefer cleaner filenames (no spaces, consistent underscores), I can rename the files and update `artifacts.html` accordingly. After adding or renaming files, open `research-methodologies/artifacts.html` to verify the embedded viewers load correctly.
