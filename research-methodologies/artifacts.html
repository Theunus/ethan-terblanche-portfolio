                    <p>The Academic Integrity Honour Pledge represented more than a formality for me. It was a personal commitment to uphold honesty and respect throughout my academic journey. It reminded me that research is a shared space built on trust, where credibility and authenticity are the foundation of meaningful scholarship. Signing it encouraged me to approach my work with a strong sense of ownership and accountability. It also prompted me to think deeply about how integrity forms part of everyday academic decision-making, from referencing to collaboration.</p>

                <h3>JBI Scoping Review — Workshop Booklet (JBI, 2023)</h3>
                <p>The Scoping Review Workshop booklet provided a strong foundation for understanding the full process of conducting a JBI-aligned scoping review. Working through the activities helped me understand how to structure a review question using the PCC framework and how inclusion and exclusion criteria flow naturally from that question. I found the section on developing a logic grid particularly useful, as it gave me a way to organise the relationships between population, concept, and context in a clear and systematic way. The examples and explanations made the methodology feel less abstract, and the workbook helped me visualise how my own research question could be refined and aligned with JBI principles. It also emphasised that scoping reviews are exploratory in nature, designed to map evidence and clarify concepts rather than to test interventions. This document guided me to see how careful planning, transparency, and structured searching support the credibility and rigour of evidence synthesis.</p>

                <p>The reference list used during the workshop gave me a deeper appreciation of how the scoping review methodology has evolved over time. Reviewing these sources—such as the foundational works by Arksey and O’Malley (2005), Levac et al. (2010), and Peters et al. (2020)—helped me understand how the JBI approach built on earlier frameworks while strengthening methodological clarity and transparency. It showed me that the JBI method is part of a broader, evolving conversation about how evidence can be synthesised to inform health practice and policy. Reading across the cited works also helped me differentiate between scoping, systematic, and realist reviews, and to appreciate why scoping reviews are well suited to emerging or complex areas of research, such as those found in Health Systems Science. These references served as a roadmap, linking theory to the practical elements of the workshop and reinforcing the importance of aligning each step of the review process with recognised methodological standards.</p>

                    <p>The reference list used during the workshop gave me a deeper appreciation of how the scoping review methodology has evolved over time. Reviewing these sources—such as the foundational works by Arksey and O’Malley (2005), Levac et al. (2010), and Peters et al. (2020)—helped me understand how the JBI approach built on earlier frameworks while strengthening methodological clarity and transparency. It showed me that the JBI method is part of a broader, evolving conversation about how evidence can be synthesised to inform health practice and policy. Reading across the cited works also helped me differentiate between scoping, systematic, and realist reviews, and to appreciate why scoping reviews are well suited to emerging or complex areas of research, such as those found in Health Systems Science. These references served as a roadmap, linking theory to the practical elements of the workshop and reinforcing the importance of aligning each step of the review process with recognised methodological standards.</p>

                <h3>Davies et al. (2022) – Reporting and Conducting Patient Journey Mapping Research in Healthcare: A Scoping Review</h3>
                <p>The article by Davies et al. (2022) was an excellent practical example of how JBI guidance can be applied in a real research project. Reading it after the workshop helped me connect the theory of evidence synthesis with how data are actually extracted, analysed, and presented in published scoping reviews. I learned how an inductive approach can be used to identify themes and justifications across studies, and how findings are synthesised narratively rather than statistically. The paper also reinforced the importance of transparency, detailed reporting, and ethical engagement when working with complex healthcare data. It was especially insightful to see how the authors used the JBI framework and PRISMA-ScR to ensure methodological rigour. This document guided my own thinking about how to structure my scoping review and encouraged me to be more intentional about documenting my process clearly and systematically.</p>

                <h2>Overall Reflection</h2>
                <p>Taken together, these artefacts tell the story of my development as a researcher in Health Systems Science. They represent not only what I have accomplished, but also how I have grown in self-awareness, responsibility, and curiosity. Research methodology has taught me to value structure without losing creativity, to think critically while staying grounded, and to remain humble in the pursuit of truth.</p>
                <p>I now see research not as a set of tasks, but as a continuous journey of learning, guided by integrity, empathy, and purpose. Each document in this portfolio reflects a step in that journey and a growing confidence in my ability to contribute meaningfully to knowledge and practice in the field of Health Systems Science.</p>
