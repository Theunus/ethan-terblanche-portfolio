            <p>This assignment helped me observe my department with more intention. I recognised how NWU's culture blends structure with creativity.

It also highlighted the impact of leadership styles on team dynamics.

            <p>This artefact examines how diversity manifests within my department at NWU and evaluates strategies for fostering inclusion.

            <p>Engaging with this assignment helped me appreciate the richness of diversity in my team. I realised that diversity extends beyond visible characteristics and includes differences in thinking, communication, and experience. Reflecting on my own department's strengths and gaps deepened my awareness of how inclusive environments are intentionally built rather than assumed. The assignment encouraged me to think about active mentorship, communication practices, and cultural celebration as pathways to strengthen inclusion.

            <h3>Observational Assignment: Conflict Resolution</h3>
            <iframe src="assets/Conflict Resolution.docx.pdf" class="pdf-view"></iframe>
            
            <h4 style="font-size:1.1rem; margin-top:1.5rem; margin-bottom:0.8rem; color:var(--black);">Context</h4>
            <p>This artefact analyses a conflict scenario between two interdependent teams within the Marketing and Student Recruitment division. It explores the root cause of the conflict, evaluates the effectiveness of the response, and applies academic conflict management frameworks such as the Thomas Kilmann model. I included this artefact because conflict is an inevitable part of organisational life, and learning how to address it constructively is essential for professional development .</p>
            
            <h4 style="font-size:1.1rem; margin-top:1.5rem; margin-bottom:0.8rem; color:var(--black);">Reflection</h4>
            <p>This assignment taught me that conflict is not necessarily negative but becomes harmful when communication is unclear or expectations are misaligned. Reflecting on the incident reinforced the importance of active listening, emotional intelligence, and transparent communication. Applying academic frameworks helped me understand that collaborative approaches often produce longer lasting solutions. This artefact strengthened my appreciation for early intervention and structured problem solving, both of which are critical in health and organisational systems.</p>

            <p>This artefact examines the leadership styles I observed within my department and compares them to leadership approaches in the South African health system.

            <h4 style="font-size:1.1rem; margin-top:1.5rem; margin-bottom:0.8rem; color:var(--black);">Reflection</h4>
            <p>Reflecting on leadership helped me recognise how much I learned from my line manager's democratic and transformational style. I realised how impactful leadership becomes when it builds confidence, encourages participation, and supports autonomy. Comparing university leadership to healthcare leadership strengthened my understanding that leadership approaches must suit their context. This artefact encouraged me to consider how empathy, communication, and vision shape team culture and outcomes. It also informed my aspiration to develop a servant transformational leadership style rooted in trust, inclusion, and accountability.</p>
