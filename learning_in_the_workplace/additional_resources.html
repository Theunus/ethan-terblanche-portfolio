            <h2>Fun Walk for Student Fees</h2>

            <h3 style="font-size:1.1rem; margin-top:1.5rem; margin-bottom:0.8rem; color:var(--black);">Context</h3>
            <p>This artefact represents a workplace initiative that I helped organise with colleagues in the Marketing and Student Recruitment division. The Fun Walk was a collaborative effort aimed at raising funds for students with outstanding fees who were at risk of exclusion or were unable to register for the new academic year. The event brought together staff members across departments who wanted to contribute towards student welfare in a meaningful way. I included this artefact because it reflects not only my project coordination involvement but also the values-driven culture in our division where supporting students extends beyond standard operational duties.</p>
            
            <p>My role in the Fun Walk involved planning logistics with colleagues, assisting with communication about the event, and ensuring that participants understood the purpose of the initiative. I contributed to organising the route, helping with registrations, and coordinating refreshments and materials. This experience demonstrated how teamwork and social responsibility can intersect with professional responsibilities in a university environment.</p>
            
            <h3 style="font-size:1.1rem; margin-top:1.5rem; margin-bottom:0.8rem; color:var(--black);">Reflection</h3>
            <p>This event became an important moment in my internship journey because it allowed me to engage with colleagues around a cause that extended beyond daily tasks. The Fun Walk reminded me of the human impact behind our work in student recruitment. While my role often focuses on marketing, branding, and communication, this initiative allowed me to support students in a direct and compassionate way.</p>
            
            <p>Working on the Fun Walk helped me understand the importance of social accountability within higher education institutions. Universities play a vital role in supporting students who face financial difficulties, and participating in this initiative made me more aware of the structural challenges students encounter when fees become a barrier to academic progression. Being part of a fundraising event taught me that even small collective actions can make a meaningful difference when a community is committed to helping others.</p>
            
            <p>The planning process strengthened my teamwork, communication, and event coordination skills. I learned how to collaborate with colleagues across different levels of seniority and how to adapt quickly when plans needed adjustment. Seeing my colleagues come together to walk for a shared purpose created a strong sense of unity and reinforced the values of empathy, care, and service that I observed throughout my time at NWU.</p>
            
            <p>This artefact is important to me because it reflects the heart of my internship experience. It showed me that professional roles within a university are not limited to administrative or operational tasks. They also involve contributing to a supportive environment where staff act as advocates for student success. The Fun Walk encouraged me to think more deeply about the type of professional I want to become. I want to be someone who not only meets organisational objectives but also remains guided by compassion and a commitment to student wellbeing.</p>
