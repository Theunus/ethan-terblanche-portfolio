            <p>I am an emerging health sciences practitioner with a growing interest in research that supports strengthened health systems, improved service delivery, and evidence-informed decision-making. Over the past year, I completed my Honours degree while working full time as a Project Coordinator in marketing and student recruitment within the higher education sector. Balancing full-time employment with postgraduate studies strengthened my ability to manage multiple responsibilities, work under pressure, and remain committed to high-quality academic and professional outputs.</p>

            <p>My professional role has provided me with experience in project planning, stakeholder engagement, and cross-functional coordination. Through this work I have developed an understanding of organisational systems, student-centred processes, and the importance of strategic communication. I am proud to have recently been entrusted with the role of Project Manager for the establishment of the upcoming medical school at the North-West University. This opportunity reflects my commitment to structured project execution, my ability to collaborate across specialised teams, and my growing leadership capacity within large-scale institutional initiatives.</p>

            <p>My academic development has been shaped by modules that focused on research methodology, systems health, innovative health solutions, health entrepreneurship, and project management in health settings. These learning experiences have strengthened my skills in critical inquiry, reflective practice, and the integration of theory with real-world contexts. I aim to apply these competencies to contribute meaningfully to research and practice that promote equity, innovation, and sustainable development within the health system.</p>

            <h2>Pre-Reflection: My mindset at the start of the course</h2>

            <p>At the beginning of this course, my mindset was shaped by a mixture of anticipation, curiosity, and a practical awareness of the demands ahead. Coming from a professional environment grounded in project coordination, marketing, and student recruitment within the higher education sector, I entered the course knowing that I was stepping into a space that required a different type of engagement. My academic background had prepared me for structured tasks and strategic planning, but I understood that the health systems sciences field would require a deeper level of conceptual thinking, reflection, and integration of theory.</p>

            <p>I approached the course with the intention to expand my understanding of how health systems operate, and how research plays a central role in shaping effective and equitable health environments. I was aware that I would need to adjust my thinking from being predominantly operational to becoming more analytical and reflective. At the start, I saw the modules as an opportunity to challenge the ways I viewed problems, to understand broader systemic interactions, and to explore how different components within the health system influence one another.</p>

            <p>Balancing full-time employment with postgraduate studies influenced my mindset significantly. I entered the course with a conscious awareness of the discipline, time management, and consistency that would be required throughout the year. I also understood that I would need to be intentional about how I engaged with the content. This included creating space to think through the material, rather than simply completing tasks. My goal was to develop a genuine understanding of the concepts, not only to fulfil academic requirements.</p>

            <p>I also remember feeling motivated by the possibility of bridging my professional experience with the learning I would gain through the course. Even though I worked outside of the traditional health environment, I recognised that the principles of systems thinking, innovation, project management, and research methodology were relevant across sectors. This made me open to discovering ways in which my existing skills could align with the competencies introduced in the modules.</p>

            <p>I expected the course to broaden my perspective, strengthen my reflective abilities, and challenge how I approached problem-solving. My mindset was not only to learn new content, but to understand how these concepts could shape my future work, particularly as I transitioned into roles with greater responsibility such as being entrusted with the project management of the upcoming NWU medical school. I viewed the course as an opportunity to prepare myself more effectively for leadership within complex systems.</p>

            <p>My mindset at the start of the course was open, inquisitive, and grounded in a desire to grow. I was ready to learn, willing to be challenged, and prepared to engage with the course material in a way that supported both academic development and professional growth.</p>
