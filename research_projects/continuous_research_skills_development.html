            <p>Throughout this course, I have developed a clearer understanding of my strengths and areas for growth
                across key research competencies. Reflecting on my progress, I identified the following areas:</p>
            <ul style="margin:0.5rem 0 1rem 1.2rem;color:var(--dark-gray)">
                <li>Information literacy: I have improved significantly in locating credible sources, using academic
                    databases, and evaluating the quality of evidence.</li>
                <li>Referencing: My confidence in applying consistent referencing techniques has grown, although I
                    continue to refine accuracy and attention to detail.</li>
                <li>Analytical reasoning: I have become more capable of interpreting literature critically, recognising
                    patterns, and synthesising ideas.</li>
                <li>Academic writing: My writing has become more structured, focused, and aligned with academic
                    conventions.</li>
                <li>Time management: Working full time while completing an Honours degree strengthened my ability to
                    plan, prioritise, and manage competing demands.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>From these competencies, I selected <strong>Information Literacy</strong> and <strong>Analytical
                    Reasoning</strong> as key areas for further development. Both were essential for my research topic
                on predictive AI models for early burnout detection and will continue to support my future academic and
                professional work.</p>

                    <iframe src="assets/JBI Certificate .pdf" title="Artifact 7 PDF"
                        style="width:100%;height:700px;border:1px solid #e6eefc;border-radius:6px"></iframe>

                </div>
                <p><strong>Why I Selected This Resource</strong></p>
                <p>I chose the JBI workshop because it offered structured training in evidence synthesis, critical
                    appraisal, and systematic approaches to locating and evaluating research. These are essential
                    components of information literacy. The workshop is recognised internationally for its research
                    standards, and attending it provided both credibility and practical skills. It also aligned closely
                    with my research focus, which required me to work with complex literature on burnout, AI
                    technologies, and health systems.</p>
                <p><strong>Reflection on Skill Development</strong></p>
                <p>The JBI workshop significantly enhanced my ability to navigate academic databases, refine search
                    strategies, and assess the quality and relevance of sources. It helped me distinguish between strong
                    evidence and weaker forms of information, and gave me tools to screen literature more efficiently. I
                    became more confident in identifying gaps, extracting key insights, and evaluating the
                    methodological strength of studies.
                    Although I have strengthened this competency, I recognise that information literacy requires
                    continuous practice. I still aim to improve my ability to manage large bodies of literature more
                    efficiently, use advanced database filters confidently, and incorporate evidence synthesis
                    techniques more consistently in future projects. I also hope to continue using JBI tools to deepen
                    my understanding of critical appraisal in AI-related health research.

                    <iframe src="assets/Faculty Booklet.pdf" title="Artifact 7 PDF"

                <p><strong>Why I Selected This Resource</strong></p>
                <p>I selected the course readings and methodology materials as key resources because they improved my
                    understanding of how to think critically about research design, logic, and evidence. These materials
                    helped me analyse research beyond surface-level descriptions and understand why certain
                    methodological choices are appropriate. This was particularly important for my topic, which required
                    me to consider AI bias, ethical implications, and burnout as a systemic issue.</p>
                <p><strong>Reflection on Skill Development</strong></p>
                <p>Throughout the course, my analytical reasoning improved as I learned how to interpret literature more
                    deeply, question assumptions, and connect concepts across different fields. I became more confident
                    in identifying relationships between variables, evaluating the strength of arguments, and
                    recognising limitations in existing studies. This competency helped me strengthen my research
                    proposal, improve the coherence of my final work, and engage more thoughtfully with the ethical
                    challenges of predictive AI.
                    Even though I have developed stronger analytical reasoning skills, I aim to continue strengthening
                    this competency by engaging with more advanced readings, practicing deeper critical comparisons
                    between studies, and improving my ability to analyse data-driven research. I also hope to develop
                    greater confidence in applying analytical thinking to real-world organisational and health system
                    problems.
