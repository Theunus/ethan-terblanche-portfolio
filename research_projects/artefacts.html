                <p>I selected this artefact because choosing my research topic was a significant milestone in shaping my
                    direction as an emerging researcher. It reflects the moment where my academic interests, exposure to
                    health systems challenges, and professional experience began to overlap in a meaningful way. The
                    artefact captures the early stage of forming a research identity, where I moved from broad curiosity
                    toward a focused and purposeful topic grounded in contemporary issues. It also demonstrates the

                <h2>Research Proposal</h2>
                <div class="artifact">
                    <p><strong>Why I Selected This Artefact</strong></p>
                    <p>I selected my research proposal as an artefact because it represents a key developmental stage in
                        my journey as an emerging researcher. The proposal brought together the foundational components
                        of the research process — problem formulation, literature engagement, methodology, ethics, and
                        feasibility.</p>
                    <p><strong>Reflection on the Artefact</strong></p>
                    <p>Reflecting on my research proposal allowed me to see how much I grew in my ability to
                        conceptualise and plan a research study. Writing the proposal required me to move beyond general
                        interest and engage deeply with existing literature on burnout, predictive analytics, clinical
                        workload pressures, and digital health innovations. This pushed me to understand the broader
                        systemic context within which burnout occurs, as well as the opportunities and limitations of
                        using artificial intelligence as an early detection tool.
                        The proposal challenged me to think critically about how to frame a research problem. I had to
                        narrow the focus, define key concepts clearly, and explain why early burnout detection matters
                        not only for individual medical doctors but also for the wider health system. This process
                        strengthened my understanding of research significance, and I learned to articulate the value of
                        the study in a way that aligned with current global health priorities.
                        Developing the methodology section was another significant learning experience. I had to
                        consider different research designs, the suitability of each method, and the practical realities
                        of studying predictive AI models in a healthcare context. This required careful thinking about
                        feasibility, data requirements, analytical approaches, and ethical considerations such as
                        privacy, risk minimisation, and responsible use of digital health technologies. The proposal
                        helped me understand why methodological alignment is essential for producing meaningful and
                        trustworthy findings.
                        In writing this artefact, I also realised how central ethics is to research involving AI and
                        healthcare professionals. The proposal required me to think through issues such as data
                        sensitivity, confidentiality, algorithmic fairness, and informed consent. This expanded my
                        understanding of the researcher’s responsibility beyond academic requirements and into the
                        ethical complexities of technology-driven health research.
                        The proposal also highlighted the iterative nature of research. It showed me that ideas evolve,
                        and that developing a research plan involves reflection, revision, and refinement. Feedback from
                        supervisors further shaped the proposal, helping me strengthen my academic reasoning, improve
                        clarity, and ensure stronger alignment between the research question, literature review, and
                        methodological approach.
                        This artefact represents a foundational step in becoming a more confident and capable
                        researcher. It marks the point where I transitioned from conceptual interest to structured
                        academic planning, and it reflects the depth of engagement required to design a coherent,
                        ethical, and relevant research study on predictive AI models for early burnout detection among
                        medical doctors.

                        <p>I selected this artefact because engaging with ethics was a critical part of my development
                            as a researcher. Ethical considerations shape the entire research process, especially in

                        <p><strong>Why I Selected This Artefact</strong></p>
                        <p>I selected my research proposal as an artefact because it represents a key developmental
                            stage in
                            my journey as an emerging researcher. The proposal brought together the foundational
                            components
                            of the research process — problem formulation, literature engagement, methodology, ethics,
                            and
                            feasibility.</p>
                        <p><strong>Reflection on the Artefact</strong></p>
                        <p>Reflecting on my ethics application and the discussions that informed it has been one of the
                            most important parts of my research journey. My topic, predictive AI models for early
                            burnout detection among medical doctors, required me to think beyond traditional ethical
                            considerations and engage with more complex issues related to technology, data governance,
                            and professional wellbeing.
                            Through the ethics process, I learned that research involving AI and healthcare workers
                            carries unique sensitivities. Burnout is a deeply personal experience, and predictive
                            modelling requires data that may include indicators of stress, workload, performance, or
                            behavioural patterns. This raised important questions for me about privacy, confidentiality,
                            and the potential unintended consequences of early identification, such as stigma, pressure,
                            or misuse of data. Ethical discussions helped me understand that protecting participants
                            goes beyond consent forms and requires an awareness of how algorithms may shape decisions,
                            perceptions, and outcomes.
                            I also became more aware of issues related to algorithmic fairness. Literature on AI ethics
                            highlights the risk of bias in data-driven models, and this influenced how I approached the
                            ethics component. It made me consider how datasets are constructed, who controls the
                            technology, and how decisions based on AI outputs may impact individuals differently. This
                            expanded my understanding of ethics as a continuous process rather than a single
                            administrative step.
                            Completing the ethics application also strengthened my ability to plan a study responsibly.
                            I had to clearly articulate the purpose of the research, justify the need for data, and
                            consider mechanisms for protecting confidentiality. I learned how to identify potential
                            risks and propose mitigation strategies, such as secure data handling, anonymisation
                            techniques, and transparent communication with participants. This reinforced the idea that
                            ethical research requires intentional planning from the earliest stages of a project.
                            The discussions with supervisors and peers further shaped my awareness of ethical
                            complexities. Our conversations helped me think about power dynamics, the role of
                            institutions, and the importance of ensuring that research outcomes do not create harm, even
                            unintentionally. These discussions also aligned with principles introduced in the GOLD01
                            supervision course, which emphasised responsible scholarship, reflexivity, and respect in
                            the research relationship.
                            This artefact represents how I have grown in my understanding of ethical practice in
                            research. It reflects a shift from seeing ethics as compliance to recognising it as a
                            central pillar of responsible, reflective, and human-centred scholarship. Engaging deeply
                            with ethics has strengthened my ability to approach future research with sensitivity,
                            awareness, and a commitment to safeguarding the wellbeing and dignity of those involved.

                    <div class="artifact">
                        <p><strong>Why I Selected This Artefact</strong></p>
                        <p>I selected my final research as an artefact because it represents the culmination of my
                            entire learning journey in this course.</p>
                        <p><strong>Reflection on the Artefact</strong></p>
                        <p>Reflecting on my final research allowed me to appreciate the progress I made throughout the
                            research cycle. Completing this project, even at a conceptual level, required sustained
                            effort, analytical thinking, and the integration of theoretical and practical insights. As I
                            revisited the proposal, literature, and ethical considerations, I realised how each step
                            contributed to shaping the final study into a coherent and meaningful piece of academic
                            work.
                            One of the key insights I gained while working on the final research was the complexity of
                            studying burnout and the importance of framing it as both an individual experience and a
                            systemic challenge. Literature consistently highlights burnout among medical doctors as a
                            global concern linked to workload, organisational culture, emotional strain, and demanding
                            clinical environments. Engaging with these sources deepened my understanding of how
                            multi-layered the issue is, and why early detection is valuable not only for individual
                            wellbeing but also for supporting stable, safe, and sustainable health systems.
                            Integrating artificial intelligence into the study introduced a different layer of
                            complexity. The final research required me to think carefully about the opportunities and
                            limitations of predictive modelling. I had to consider issues such as data quality, model
                            accuracy, contextual relevance, and the importance of avoiding bias. This encouraged me to
                            approach the topic with balanced reasoning, recognising both the promise of AI-driven early
                            detection and the ethical, practical, and methodological challenges involved. Working
                            through these considerations strengthened my ability to think critically and evaluate the
                            feasibility of innovative health solutions.
                            Completing the final research also highlighted the importance of academic writing and the
                            process of refining ideas through multiple drafts. I learned how to synthesise literature
                            more effectively, write with greater clarity, and structure an argument in a way that aligns
                            with the expectations of scholarly work. This reflects a significant shift from the early
                            stages of the course, where I often focused on content alone, by the end, I had developed a
                            stronger sense of academic voice, structure, and coherence.
                            The supervision process played an important role in shaping the final research, and
                            completing the project reminded me of how valuable feedback and guidance are in
                            strengthening academic work. I learned to view supervision as collaboration and refinement
                            rather than correction. The GOLD01 course reinforced this, helping me engage with feedback
                            intentionally and with a clearer understanding of my responsibilities as a developing
                            researcher.
                            This artefact represents much more than the final product, it symbolises the full arc of my
                            development. It reflects growth in confidence, academic maturity, ethical awareness,
                            methodological understanding, and my emerging research identity. Completing the final
                            research has given me a greater appreciation for the discipline of research and a stronger
                            sense of readiness to engage in future academic or professional projects that require
                            critical inquiry and evidence-informed reasoning.
