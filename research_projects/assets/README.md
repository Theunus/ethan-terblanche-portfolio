This folder is for PDFs, screenshots and other assets you want to display on the research project pages.

Place files here and reference them from the pages in the parent folder, for example:

`<a href="assets/your-file.pdf">Open PDF</a>`

You can also create subfolders (e.g. `pdfs/`, `screenshots/`).
