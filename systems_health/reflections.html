        <h1>Tab Number 2: Reflections on the course</h1>

        <section>
            <h2>Reflection 1: Understanding Systems Health</h2>
            <p>At the beginning of this module, my understanding of Systems Health was limited to the idea of how healthcare institutions function. As the course progressed, I began to see it as a much broader and interconnected field that examines how people, processes, and policies work together to deliver care. I learned that a health system is more than hospitals and clinics; it includes the social, economic, and environmental factors that influence health outcomes. This understanding helped me to view healthcare as a dynamic system that must balance efficiency, equity, and sustainability.</p>

            <p>One of the key lessons I took from the module was the value of systems thinking. I learned that to understand a problem within a health system, one must look beyond the immediate issue and explore its wider causes and consequences. This approach has encouraged me to think more critically about how different parts of the system interact and how small improvements in one area can lead to larger positive effects elsewhere.</p>

            <p>Through group discussions and readings, I also recognised that leadership and collaboration play an important role in systems health. Effective leaders view health challenges holistically and work to integrate solutions across multiple sectors. This idea has influenced the way I approach teamwork and decision-making. I now try to think more strategically and consider how my actions contribute to the larger system. Overall, my understanding of Systems Health has deepened, and I feel more aware of the complexity and importance of integrated approaches in improving population health.</p>

            <h2>Reflection 2: Financial Competencies in Health Systems</h2>
            <p>Engaging with the financial aspects of health systems has been one of the most valuable parts of this module. Initially, I found the topic of financial management in healthcare quite daunting, as I associated it mainly with numbers and budgeting. However, as I learned more about financial planning, resource allocation, and health economics, I began to appreciate its relevance to system efficiency and sustainability. Understanding financial competencies has shown me that good health outcomes depend not only on clinical care but also on how resources are distributed and managed.</p>

            <p>I have come to understand that financial decision-making in health systems is guided by principles of equity and accountability. Learning about budgeting processes and funding flows helped me see how decisions made at policy level affect service delivery on the ground. It also made me more aware of the challenges faced by managers who must balance limited resources with growing health demands.</p>

            <p>Developing my financial competencies has also helped me to think more analytically. I have started to approach problems by considering both their financial and systemic implications. For example, I now think about how introducing a new health intervention might affect budgets, staffing, and long-term sustainability. This integrated way of thinking has strengthened my ability to evaluate problems from multiple perspectives. Overall, learning about financial competencies has enhanced my understanding of how economic reasoning supports better health outcomes and more resilient systems.</p>

            <h2>Reflection 3: Integrating Health Systems Science into Practice</h2>
            <p>As the course continued, I began to see how the different aspects of health systems science connect to practical work in healthcare and community settings. I learned that health systems science bridges clinical knowledge with systems-based thinking, leadership, and improvement science. It helps practitioners understand how to deliver care within complex systems that involve policies, teams, and communities. This broader view has helped me to think about health not only as the treatment of illness but also as the coordination of care, innovation, and prevention.</p>

            <p>Throughout the module, I have reflected on how systems thinking can be applied to real-world challenges. For example, when studying case scenarios about system inefficiencies, I learned to identify root causes and consider solutions that involve collaboration across different levels of the system. I have also gained an appreciation for how health systems science emphasises continuous learning and improvement. This perspective encourages practitioners to adapt, reflect, and find creative ways to improve care delivery.</p>

            <p>This module has helped me develop both professionally and personally. I have gained confidence in analysing system problems, understanding data, and engaging with concepts such as quality improvement and sustainability. It has also strengthened my appreciation for interdisciplinary work and leadership in health. Going forward, I plan to apply these insights in my future professional practice, using systems thinking to promote fairness, innovation, and effectiveness in healthcare delivery.</p>

            <h2>Reflection on My Personal Development Plan and Financial Competencies</h2>
            <p>Reflecting on my personal development plan has given me valuable insight into how I learn and grow as both a student and a developing professional within Systems Health. The two competencies I chose to focus on, confidence in taking initiative and risk tolerance, have remained central to my personal and academic growth throughout the course. I have come to understand that confidence is not something that appears suddenly but develops gradually through experience, preparation, and reflection. By taking small steps, such as speaking first in group settings, proposing ideas for improvement, or volunteering to take responsibility for certain tasks, I have learned to trust my own judgement more. These experiences have helped me see that initiative is an active process that involves both courage and self-awareness.</p>

            <p>Through this process, I also realised that confidence is closely linked to reflection. Each time I evaluate my actions and decisions, I can identify what went well and where I can improve. Rather than viewing uncertainty as something negative, I have started to see it as a natural part of growth. Developing risk tolerance has therefore required a shift in mindset. I have worked to accept that not all outcomes can be controlled, and that learning often takes place in uncertain and changing circumstances. Participating in group activities that involved problem-solving and decision-making under pressure helped me build this resilience. Over time, I have become more comfortable navigating complexity, especially when solutions are not straightforward.</p>

            <p>In relation to financial competencies, my understanding has developed from a basic awareness of budgets and costs to a deeper appreciation of how financial management shapes the effectiveness and fairness of health systems. I have learned that financial literacy is essential for all health professionals, as it supports informed decision-making and ensures that limited resources are used responsibly. Understanding topics such as health economics, funding mechanisms, and resource allocation has shown me how financial strategies can either strengthen or weaken a system’s ability to deliver equitable care.</p>

            <p>This learning has also influenced how I think about leadership and accountability. I have come to see that strong financial competencies allow for transparent and ethical decision-making. They enable professionals to justify their choices and to work towards sustainability in both organisational and community contexts. By connecting financial reasoning with system improvement, I have developed a more holistic perspective on how resources, people, and policies interact.</p>

            <p>Overall, reflecting on my personal development plan has highlighted how intertwined personal growth and professional learning are. Developing confidence and risk tolerance has helped me approach financial and systemic challenges with a more open and analytical mindset. I now feel more prepared to contribute meaningfully to discussions about resource management, system design, and improvement. I see reflection not as a separate task but as an ongoing process that deepens my understanding and strengthens my ability to apply knowledge responsibly. As I continue to develop, I intend to maintain this reflective approach to learning and practice, using it to guide both my academic progress and my professional journey within health systems science.</p>
