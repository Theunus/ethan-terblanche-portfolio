                <h2>Tab Number 1: Who I am in Systems Health</h2>
                <p><strong>Pre-Reflection on My Entrepreneurial Mindset</strong></p>
                <p>As I begin to reflect on my entrepreneurial mindset, I recognise that this concept extends beyond business or profit. In the context of health systems, it relates to the ability to think creatively, identify opportunities for improvement, and approach challenges with a sense of curiosity and innovation. I see entrepreneurship as a mindset that values adaptability, problem-solving, and resilience in environments that are often complex and resource constrained.</p>
                <p>I believe that I naturally approach tasks with a solution-oriented perspective. When faced with challenges, I tend to think about how systems and processes can be improved rather than focusing only on the problem itself. This way of thinking aligns with the idea of innovation in systems health, where one must constantly balance structure with flexibility. I often find motivation in finding ways to make processes more efficient or more responsive to the needs of people and communities.</p>
                <p>At the same time, I recognise that an entrepreneurial mindset involves a certain level of risk-taking and confidence in one’s ideas. I am still developing this aspect of myself. I tend to seek validation and assurance before taking initiative, especially in professional or academic settings. However, I am learning that entrepreneurship also means embracing uncertainty and being willing to test ideas, even when the outcome is not fully known. This is an area where I aim to grow by allowing myself to take calculated risks and learn from both success and failure.</p>
                <p>I also value collaboration as part of my entrepreneurial thinking. I have learned that creativity often develops through teamwork and shared reflection. Within health systems, innovation rarely occurs in isolation. It requires diverse perspectives and collective effort. I enjoy engaging with others to refine ideas and to find practical ways to implement change. I see this as a key strength that supports my developing entrepreneurial mindset.</p>
                <p>I view my entrepreneurial mindset as a growing part of my professional identity. It encourages me to think differently, remain open to learning, and approach health systems challenges with optimism and persistence. As I continue in this module, I hope to strengthen my ability to connect innovative thinking with meaningful action, while maintaining a grounded understanding of the systems and people involved.</p>

                <h3>Continuous Personal Development Plan</h3>
                <p>In reflecting on my entrepreneurial mindset, I have identified two key competencies that I wish to develop further. These are confidence in taking initiative and risk tolerance. Both are essential in supporting creative and innovative thinking within health systems and in allowing me to approach challenges with a balanced sense of courage and responsibility.</p>

                <h4>1. Confidence in Taking Initiative</h4>
                <p>I have realised that confidence is an important aspect of entrepreneurship. It involves trusting my judgement and being willing to take the first step in testing an idea or leading a process. At times, I tend to wait for validation or reassurance before moving forward. To develop greater confidence, I plan to begin by setting small, manageable goals within my academic and professional environment. For example, I can take the lead in small group discussions or propose an idea for improvement within a team project. These experiences can help me practise decision-making in a supportive setting.</p>

                <h4>2. Developing Risk Tolerance</h4>
                <p>Entrepreneurial thinking often requires comfort with uncertainty and change. I tend to prefer clear structures and predictable outcomes, yet I recognise that growth often occurs when one steps beyond the familiar. To develop greater tolerance for risk, I will start by reframing my understanding of failure. I want to view setbacks as opportunities for learning rather than as signs of inadequacy.</p>

                <h4>Reflection</h4>
                <p>By focusing on these two areas, I aim to strengthen my entrepreneurial mindset in a way that aligns with my values and professional goals. Developing confidence and risk tolerance will support my ability to think innovatively within health systems and contribute meaningfully to positive change. I see this as a gradual process that involves continuous learning, self-awareness, and reflection.</p>
