            <h2>Mapping Out Finance Positions</h2>
            <p><a class="miro" href="https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVMVniX9s=/" target="_blank">https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVMVniX9s=/</a></p>
            <p>(Junior Finance Manager/Admin, Resource Allocation Manager, Group Controlling Finance Officer)</p>
            <p><strong>Linked Health Systems Science Competency:</strong> Systems Thinking and Health Care Finance Literacy</p>
            <p>This artefact represents my exploration of financial roles within the broader health system, specifically those that influence the allocation and management of resources. By identifying and mapping positions such as Junior Finance Manager/Admin, Resource Allocation Manager, and Group Controlling Finance Officer, I gained a clearer understanding of how financial decisions and administrative structures support system performance. Each role contributes to the efficient use of funds, transparent reporting, and accountability, all essential elements for maintaining a sustainable and equitable health system.</p>

            <p>In reflecting on this artefact, I recognised that these positions require both analytical and ethical competencies. They link directly to the financial competencies I have been developing in this module, such as resource allocation, financial planning, and systems awareness. Understanding these roles helped me appreciate how financial officers act as key connectors between management, operations, and service delivery. They ensure that financial resources align with health priorities and that expenditure supports quality care outcomes.</p>

            <p>Selecting these positions was intentional, as they each represent a different level of responsibility within the financial structure of a health system. Analysing them allowed me to reflect on how effective financial management underpins system stability, policy implementation, and health equity. This exercise reinforced my understanding of Systems Health by showing how financial and administrative competencies are not separate from patient care but integral to achieving effective and sustainable health outcomes.</p>

            <h2>Presentation on the Priority Setting Framework (CHNRI)</h2>
            <p>(Add in Presentation - Named Child and Maternal Health)</p>
            <p><strong>Linked Health Systems Science Competency:</strong> Health Policy, Systems Thinking, and Evidence-Based Decision-Making</p>
            <p>This artefact represents a group presentation on the Child Health and Nutrition Research Initiative (CHNRI) framework, which focused on how health research priorities are identified and ranked to ensure fairness, transparency, and impact. Preparing and presenting this work deepened my understanding of how systematic frameworks support decision-making in health systems. Through the process, I learned how evidence-based methods can guide limited resources toward the most pressing health challenges, especially in contexts such as South Africa’s quadruple disease burden.</p>

            <p>Working on this presentation strengthened my ability to analyse health policies from a systems perspective. It helped me appreciate how the CHNRI framework combines inclusivity, accountability, and adaptability to different contexts. Collaborating with my peers allowed me to practise teamwork and communication while exploring how structured prioritisation supports both equity and efficiency in healthcare planning.</p>

            <p>Reflecting on this artefact, I realised how essential frameworks like CHNRI are for aligning research with public health goals and ensuring that health investments are made ethically and transparently. This learning experience reinforced my understanding that systems health is not only about clinical interventions but also about fair and evidence-driven decision-making that strengthens the entire health system.</p>

            <h2>Health Financing Reforms (Activity 2.4.2 – Egypt)</h2>
            <p>(Add document named Act 2.4.2)</p>
            <p><strong>Linked Health Systems Science Competency:</strong> Health Policy, Financing, and Systems Strengthening</p>
            <p>This artefact explores Egypt’s health financing reforms and provided me with a deeper understanding of how countries manage financial resources to move towards universal health coverage. Through this activity, I learned about the importance of raising revenue sustainably, pooling funds efficiently, and purchasing services strategically to achieve equity and access. Analysing Egypt’s approach helped me see how financial mechanisms, such as universal health insurance and strategic purchasing, can reduce health disparities and improve accountability.</p>

            <p>Reflecting on this learning, I realised that effective health financing reform is not just about funding healthcare but about building a system that distributes resources fairly and transparently. I was particularly interested in how Egypt’s Universal Health Insurance law introduced gradual coverage expansion and targeted subsidies for vulnerable groups. This highlighted the need for financial protection policies that consider both direct and indirect costs faced by patients.</p>

            <p>Connecting this to the South African context helped me understand how health financing principles can be adapted to local needs. The exercise encouraged me to think about how lessons from Egypt could inform the development of South Africa’s National Health Insurance system, especially in defining benefit packages, ensuring strong governance, and maintaining accountability. I also reflected on how these financial strategies align with systems health thinking, where sustainable reform depends on collaboration, equity, and ongoing evaluation.</p>

            <p>This activity reinforced my appreciation for the complexity of financing health systems and showed me how financial policy shapes the broader goals of health equity and universal coverage. It has encouraged me to continue developing my understanding of health economics and policy so that I can contribute more effectively to future health system improvement initiatives.</p>

            <h2>Health Systems Strategy and Policy Assignments</h2>
            <p>(Add assignments here: Still to be completed, will send through after completed)</p>
            <p><strong>Linked Health Systems Science Competency:</strong> Health Systems Design, Policy Analysis, and Financial Stewardship</p>
            <p>These artefacts collectively reflect my growing understanding of how health systems are shaped by policy, strategy, and financing structures. Working on the white paper and strategy document allowed me to explore the processes through which ideas become policy directions and how these influence the functioning of a health system. I learned that effective strategies depend on evidence-based decision-making, collaboration, and continuous evaluation. Writing these documents helped me appreciate the complexity of policy development, where each recommendation must balance public health priorities with financial sustainability and equity.</p>

            <p>Critiquing current payment models and examining mechanisms for revenue raising and pooling encouraged me to think more deeply about how resources flow through a health system. I realised that payment mechanisms are not just technical processes but tools that shape provider behaviour, efficiency, and access to care. Exploring different approaches, such as capitation and diagnosis-related groups, allowed me to see how financing methods can support or undermine universal health coverage depending on how they are designed and regulated. Reflecting on these critiques helped me to connect theoretical concepts with real-world challenges faced by health systems.</p>

            <p>Through these assignments, I have developed a greater appreciation for the role of financial stewardship in ensuring that limited resources are used responsibly. I now understand that raising and pooling funds effectively requires transparency, accountability, and alignment with health priorities. These artefacts also strengthened my ability to evaluate health policy critically yet constructively, always considering the social, economic, and ethical dimensions of reform.</p>

            <p>Engaging with these tasks deepened my systems thinking skills and enhanced my understanding of how financial and strategic decisions affect service delivery and health outcomes. This learning experience has motivated me to continue developing my ability to integrate policy, finance, and system design to contribute meaningfully to sustainable health reforms in the future.</p>

            <h2>Evidence of Engagement (Sparks, Activities, and Module Reflections)</h2>
            <p><strong>Linked Health Systems Science Competency:</strong> Systems Thinking, Financial Literacy, and Continuous Learning in Health Systems</p>
            <p>These artefact brings together three examples of my engagement throughout the Systems Health module. Each task encouraged me to think differently about how health systems function and how theory connects to practice. The Spark discussion, the activity on complex adaptive systems, and the reflection on health expenditure classification all contributed to shaping my understanding of how systems operate, adapt, and are financed.</p>

            <h3>Spark: What are the Key Components of the Healthcare System?</h3>
            <p>Engaging with this Spark allowed me to identify and explore the essential building blocks that make up a healthcare system. Through this task, I learned that a healthcare system includes much more than medical facilities. It involves people, financing structures, governance, information systems, and service delivery mechanisms that interact to promote health and equity. Reflecting on this helped me appreciate the complexity of coordination among these elements and how they work together to achieve system goals. I also realised that weaknesses in one area, such as financing or leadership, can affect the performance of the entire system. This activity strengthened my systems thinking competency, as it encouraged me to look beyond individual components and to consider how they influence one another.</p>

            <h3>Activity 1.1.1: Defining Complex Adaptive Systems</h3>
            <p>(Add document named Activity 1.1.1)</p>
            <p>This activity deepened my understanding of how health systems behave as complex adaptive systems. I learned that such systems are not linear and cannot always be predicted. They change and evolve in response to both internal and external pressures. Reflecting on this concept helped me see that health systems require flexibility and learning to adapt to challenges such as resource shortages or changing disease patterns. Through this exercise, I also recognised the importance of communication and collaboration between stakeholders to ensure that the system responds effectively to emerging needs. Personally, this activity encouraged me to become more comfortable with uncertainty and to value adaptability as a key part of system improvement.</p>

            <h3>Spark: Challenges in Formulating and Classifying Health Expenditures in National Budgets</h3>
            <p>In this reflection, I engaged with the financial side of health systems and began to understand how challenging it can be to categorise and allocate health spending within national budgets. I realised that financial data do more than record expenditure; they reflect a country’s health priorities and values. This activity improved my awareness of the complexity involved in managing health finances and the importance of transparency and accountability in public spending. I also learned that financial classification affects how resources are distributed, which in turn influences access and equity in healthcare delivery. Reflecting on this helped me connect financial literacy to systems health, showing me that sound financial management is essential for sustainability and fairness within a health system.</p>

            <h3>Module Reflections</h3>
            <h4>Budget Matters for Health</h4>
            <p>My personal takeaway from the session on budget matters for health is a much deeper appreciation of how financial planning influences every level of the health system. Before this session, I saw budgeting mainly as a technical or administrative process. Through the discussion, I began to understand that budgets represent priorities and values, showing how resources are distributed to meet health needs fairly and effectively. I realised that financial management is not only about numbers but also about making decisions that impact people’s access to care and the overall functioning of the system.</p>

            <p>This session helped me to think more critically about how limited resources can be managed responsibly to achieve the greatest benefit for communities. I learned that effective budgeting requires both transparency and adaptability, as circumstances in healthcare often change. I also recognised that financial planning should include input from different stakeholders to ensure that funds are used where they are needed most. This understanding encouraged me to view budgeting as a shared process that depends on collaboration, foresight, and accountability.</p>

            <p>From the perspective of my work placement, I can see how these principles apply in practice. During my placement, I observed how departments plan their spending for training, equipment, and community outreach. I noticed that when budgeting decisions are made with clear goals and communication, they have a positive effect on service delivery and staff morale. This experience reinforced the idea that financial planning supports not only efficiency but also equity within the system.</p>

            <h4>Understanding Cash Flow Statements</h4>
            <p>Learning about cash flow statements has given me a much clearer understanding of how financial management supports the stability and sustainability of healthcare organisations. I realised that cash flow is not only about tracking income and expenses but about ensuring that resources are available at the right time to maintain operations and deliver quality care. Understanding how funds move in and out of an organisation has helped me see how financial planning influences decisions around staffing, equipment, and service delivery. It also highlighted how important it is for healthcare managers to anticipate challenges and manage resources carefully to avoid interruptions in care.</p>

            <p>This topic made me more aware of the link between financial transparency and accountability. A well-maintained cash flow statement provides insight into the organisation’s overall health and helps leaders make informed decisions. I now see that financial information is not just for accountants or managers, but for all professionals who contribute to the effective functioning of the system. It strengthened my understanding of how financial literacy supports collaboration and helps teams work towards common goals.</p>

            <h4>Working in a Team of Six</h4>
            <p>Working in a team of six during this module was a valuable learning experience that helped me understand both the challenges and rewards of collaboration in a professional setting. Each member brought different strengths, perspectives, and ways of thinking, which made our discussions and outputs more balanced and creative. I realised that teamwork in health systems, much like in our group, depends on effective communication, respect for diversity, and a shared sense of purpose.</p>

            <p>Through this experience, I learned the importance of listening actively and recognising the value of each person’s contribution. At times, coordinating tasks and aligning ideas required patience and flexibility, but these moments helped me develop stronger interpersonal and problem-solving skills. I also gained a better understanding of how leadership and collaboration coexist, effective teamwork is not about one person taking control, but about creating space for everyone to contribute and feel responsible for the outcome.</p>

            <p>I found that when we divided tasks according to our strengths, the work became more efficient and the final product reflected a combination of everyone’s effort. I also noticed how constructive feedback and mutual support built confidence within the group. This reminded me that professional collaboration in healthcare relies on trust, open communication, and shared accountability.</p>

            <p>Reflecting on this experience, I see how teamwork aligns with the values of health systems science, particularly systems thinking and interprofessional collaboration. Just as different components of a system must work together to function effectively, a team succeeds when individuals work collectively towards a common goal. This experience has strengthened my confidence in group work and shown me how collaboration contributes to learning, innovation, and professional growth.</p>
